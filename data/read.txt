put your data in this folder


Each data subfolder contains images named as 
`00001.jpg`, `00002.jpg`, etc.   

The naming format of each image is defined in [config/config.yaml](config/config.yaml) by the sentence:
 `image_filename_format: "{:05d}.jpg"`.



The images to be used as training data and their label are configured by this txt file:
 [data/folder/valid_images.txt](data/folder/valid_images.txt). 

```
jump_03-02-12-34-01-795
52 59
72 79


kick_03-02-12-36-05-185
54 62
```


In each paragraph,  
the 1st line is the data folder name, 
which should start with `"${class_name}_"`. 
The 2nd and following lines specify the
 `staring index` and `ending index` of the video that corresponds to that class.



Let's take the 1st paragraph of the above snapshot as an example: `jump` is the class,
 and the frames `52~59` & `72~79` of the video are used for training.



## Classes

The classes are set in [config/config.yaml](config/config.yaml) under the key word `classes`.
 No matter how many classes you put in the training data (set by the folder name),
 only the ones that match with the classes in **config.yaml** are used for training and inference.
