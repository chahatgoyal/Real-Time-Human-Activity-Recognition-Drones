  # Input:
  #   For the input data_type, data_path, and model_path,
  #   please use the command line arguments.
  # Output:
  #   The result video and skeleton txts will be saved to
  #       ${args.output_folder}/${DST_FOLDER_NAME}/${video_name}
  #       ${args.output_folder}/${DST_FOLDER_NAME}/${skeleton_folder_name}/${skeleton_filename_format}
  #   where `DST_FOLDER_NAME` is defined in the function `get_dst_folder_name`.
  #   In short, the input video or folder will have the same output folder name;
  #             the input webcam will have a time stamp as the folder name.
